Add images to pages 
==================================================================================================================== 

Use the command '..image: <image file address>' to add an image to the page. The images are higher quality if they are sourced from upload rather than downloading them into the VM (using 'curl')  and using them, but there is an image file to organise images if needed. I used imgbb to upload screenshots, as this was the highest quality I found.
